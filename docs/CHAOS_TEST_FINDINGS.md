# Chaos Testing Findings — M8

**Date:** September 21, 2026
**Scope:** Systematic outage testing across all four signal sources (GPIO, S7, OPC-UA, Modbus), per ROADMAP M8 ("offline-resilience chaos testing").

## Method

For each signal source, the underlying process/server was killed entirely
(`systemctl stop` on the simulator or PLC-facing service — not just a
network blip), while watching whether the dashboard correctly showed the
machine as `down` during the outage, and recovered automatically once the
service was restarted.

## Findings

| Source | Before | Root cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| **GPIO** | ✅ Always correct | Pull-down wiring reads a broken/disconnected line as `down` at the hardware level — no software logic needed. | None needed. |
| **S7** | ❌ Froze on last known status | `s7_bridge.py`'s own reconnect loop caught connection errors and retried silently, without ever emitting a `down` status line. | Emit `{"kind":"machine_status","status":"down"}` once per outage, before the retry loop; re-announce the real status explicitly on reconnect. |
| **Modbus** | ❌ Froze on last known status | `ModbusSignalSource.ts` had no reconnection logic at all — a failed poll just logged and gave up. | Added reconnect-on-failure logic, plus an explicit synthetic `down` emission on the first failed poll of an outage. |
| **OPC-UA** | ❌ Froze on last known status, plus a growing backlog of unresolved requests | `node-opcua`'s `session.read()` doesn't reject when the connection drops — it queues the request indefinitely while node-opcua reconnects in the background. Combined with our `setInterval` firing regardless, this piled up pending `ReadRequest`s (node-opcua's own "sending multiple requests simultaneously" warning). | Added a `pollInFlight` guard (never start a new read while one is outstanding) and a 3-second timeout on the read, treating a stuck read as a failure that surfaces a `down` status. |

## Verification

Each fix was confirmed by killing the corresponding simulator process
entirely and observing, on the live dashboard, that the machine's status
switched to `down` within a few seconds of the outage starting, and back
to its real status within a few seconds of the service being restarted —
with no manual intervention (no edge-agent restart needed) in any case.

## Remaining known gaps (not addressed in this pass)

- The GPIO/S7 shared `ProcessBridgeSignalSource` now respawns a crashed
  bridge process after a fixed 5-second delay, indefinitely — there is no
  backoff (e.g. exponential) if the underlying problem is persistent. For
  a short-lived pilot this is acceptable; worth revisiting if a bridge
  process crash-loops for an extended period in production.
- None of the four sources currently retry a *specific* failed read — on
  a timeout or error, the next attempt starts fresh rather than replaying
  exactly what was missed. Given the poll-and-diff model (a counter is
  re-read fully next time, not incrementally), this is not a data-loss
  risk, just worth noting as a design property.
